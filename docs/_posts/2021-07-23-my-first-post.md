# Hello World!

As a developer, whenever you are learning a new programming language, framework, technology or tool, the first thing you will do to measure your success is to write a "hello world" program.

It will be as simple as writing in the _stdout_ `Hello World`. Writing into a file, or put a label in a UI.

I'm testing this Jekyll setup for writing down blog posts or articles that could be beneficial for someone. So, as tradition mandates:

Hello World!
